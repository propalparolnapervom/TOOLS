## WHAT

Run simplest AMI creation:
- there's a source AMI  
- create a new AMI (with latest versions of `traceroute` and `httpd` installed via `Ansible`)
- run a `Goss` test to make sure that `traceroute` and `httpd` were really installed

## PREPARE GOSS

You need goss to get the packer build to run.

Folow the instuctions on:

[https://github.com/YaleUniversity/packer-provisioner-goss](https://github.com/YaleUniversity/packer-provisioner-goss)

Remember to make the binary executable!
