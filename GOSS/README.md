## What is Goss?

**Goss** is a YAML based serverspec alternative tool for validating a server’s configuration. 

It eases the process of writing tests by allowing the user to generate tests from the current system state. 

Once the test suite is written they can be executed, waited-on, or served as a health endpoint.
