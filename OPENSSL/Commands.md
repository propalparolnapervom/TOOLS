## CSR (Certificate Signing Request)
[CSR](https://www.sslshopper.com/what-is-a-csr-certificate-signing-request.html)

> The process: Generate SSL CSR in my local computer then send the CSR to the provider and then use SSL Cert in my server. A certificate authority will use a CSR to create your SSL certificate, but it does not need your private key. You need to keep your private key secret. The certificate created with a particular CSR will only work with the private key that was generated with it. So if you lose the private key, the certificate will no longer work.

### Generate

Generate a CSR and private key
```
openssl req -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privateKey.key
```

Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) for an existing private key
```
openssl req -out CSR.csr -key privateKey.key -new
```

Generate a certificate signing request based on an existing certificate
```
openssl x509 -x509toreq -in certificate.crt -out CSR.csr -signkey privateKey.key
```


### Show
What is contained in a CSR
```
openssl req -in server.csr -noout -text

## CERTIFICATE

### Generate
Generate a self-signed certificate
```
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out certificate.crt

```

Which public key is in the certificate
```
openssl x509 -pubkey -noout < real.crt
```


### Generate

#### Public and private key (RSA algo)

create pub and priv keys (an RSA key of 1024 bits)
```
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 1024
```
generate separate pub key for the file above
```
openssl rsa -in key.pem -pubout -out pub-key.pem
```
